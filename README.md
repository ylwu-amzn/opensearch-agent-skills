# OpenSearch Agent Skills

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) for building search applications and analyzing observability data with OpenSearch. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Kiro, and any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard.

## Available Skills

Skills are organized in a tree — install the whole collection or pick individual skills.

| Category | Skill | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Search** | [opensearch-launchpad](skills/opensearch-skills/search/opensearch-launchpad/) | Build search apps from scratch — BM25, semantic, hybrid, agentic search; LLM-powered query rewriting and grounded RAG |
| **Ingestion** | [ml-inference-ingest](skills/opensearch-skills/ingestion/ml-inference-ingest/) | Wire any ML model into an ingest pipeline — auto-embeddings, classification, NER, PII redaction, summarization at index time |
| **Observability** | [log-analytics](skills/opensearch-skills/observability/log-analytics/) | Query and analyze logs with PPL — error patterns, anomaly detection |
| **Observability** | [trace-analytics](skills/opensearch-skills/observability/trace-analytics/) | Investigate distributed traces — slow spans, service maps, agent invocations |
| **Cloud** | [aws-setup](skills/opensearch-skills/cloud/aws-setup/) | Deploy to Amazon OpenSearch Service or Serverless |
| **Migration** | [solr-opensearch-migration-advisor](skills/solr-opensearch-migration-advisor/) | Migration companion for Apache Solr → OpenSearch — translate schemas, Standard/DisMax/eDisMax queries, and plan cluster sizing. Mirrored from [opensearch-migrations](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/tree/main/AIAdvisor/skills/solr-opensearch-migration-advisor) |

## Install

Install using [`npx skills`](https://agentskills.io):

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills

# Install a specific skill
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills@opensearch-launchpad --full-depth
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills@ml-inference-ingest --full-depth
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills@log-analytics --full-depth
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills@trace-analytics --full-depth
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills@aws-setup --full-depth
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills@solr-opensearch-migration-advisor --full-depth
```

### Install options

```bash
# Install to a specific agent
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills -a claude-code

# Install globally (available across all projects)
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills -g

# Install to all detected agents
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills --all

# List available skills before installing
npx skills add opensearch-project/opensearch-agent-skills --list
```

### Claude Community Marketplace (Claude Code)

```bash
# Add the community marketplace (one-time setup)
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-community

# Install the plugin
/plugin install opensearch-agent-skills@claude-community

# Reload to apply
/reload-plugins
```

After installing, try:

> *"I want to build a semantic search app with OpenSearch"*

Your agent reads the skill instructions and runs the scripts directly — no MCP server required.
